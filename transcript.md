# Introduction to voice Technology

## Introduction and welcome

Thanks everyone for your time and for coming tonight, I know many of you have competing demands on your time. I'm Kathy Reid, Director of Developer Relations for Mycroft AI, an open source voice recognition startup based in States, and I'm also President of Linux Australia, the voice of Australia's open source community. I work at the intersection of technical communities, emerging technology, helping to bring structure, frameworks and order to the chaos that can be emerging tech.

### Partners
I'd like to give my sincere thanks too to Creative Geelong, and Jennifer Cromarty for hosting ushere at the Creative Geelong Makers Hub. This event is also part of the Victorian Digital Innovation Festival, which you can follow on social media with the handles on screen there.

### Acknowledgement of Country
I'd like to acknowledge that our event tonight is held on the land of the Wadawarrung people of the Kulin nations, the traditional custodians of the land, and we pay our respects to elders past and present.

## Overview

>  "Be a voice not an echo"

This is one of my favourite quotes from Albert Einstein - a man who continually innovated, who picked apart problems, who was a deep thinker and held unconventional views. My hope is that after tonight's session you'll be able to form your own informed opinions about voice technology - what it is, where it's going, and how it should form a part of your organisation's technical strategy and roadmap.

So, what are we going to cover tonight?

* A brief history of computer interaction

We'll take a look at how voice is a natural evolution in many ways for human computer interaction

* Voice in fiction and voice in real life

We'll look at how voice technology is represented in fiction, and talk a little bit about how it's set our expectations for how voice should work in real life - and how there's still a bit of a difference between fiction and reality.

* Different voice technologies

We'll look at the different voice technologies that are available currently in the market, and where they sit on a continuum of complexity from simple to advanced.

* Anatomy of a voice stack

Digging a bit deeper into the technology itself, we'll take apart the voice technology stack, and take a deep dive into how different layers in the stack work.

* Challenges and opportunities of Voice

We'll take a look at some of the use cases for voice - and why it works in some situations much better than typing or touch. We'll also look at some of the challenges in voice, and how the technical community is overcoming them.

* Your action plan

We'll finish off the session by chatting about what you can be doing in your organisation to prepare for voice, and what you need to be thinking about for your technical roadmaps and strategies.

## A brief history of computer interaction

Some of you in the room might be old enought to remember these - punch cards - and older computers in the 1960s and 1970s were programmed this way - by punching cards with a program or routine and then loading the cards into the computer - which was usually the size of a house.

We moved on to keyboard input - and then in the mid 1980s the mouse came along and the graphical user interface was born, popularised by the Apple Mac. We started to move into touch interfaces with graphical tablets - shown here with this Wacom Bamboo pen, and then both mobile phones and even computers themselves adopted touch based displays.

SLIDE: Wiimote

We've also seen a rise in what we call gesture control - for instance the Wiimote uses gestures in the Wiimote controllers to figure out how fast you moved, and where you moved.  We're seeing gesture control being used a lot more extensively in interactive displays such as this one.

SLIDE: Interactive display

So, you can see a natural evolution here.

SLIDE: Voice technology

Voice technology is another natural evolution for human computer interaction - instead of using a pointer or gestures, it uses the power of speech to control what a computer does.

## Voice technology in fiction and in real life

And of course this power of speech has been used significantly in fiction - predominatly sci-fi. Shall we take alook?

### Themes coming out of voice technology

So you can see that although some of these are quite funny - the Scottish elevator gets me every time - they raise really interesting questions about the challenges of voice technology.

What were some of the issues that you heard in the videos?

* Robotic sounding voices
* Difficulties understanding accents
* Difficulties understanding changes in a person's physical state - dentist
* Poorly recognised intents, the system didn't understand
* No manual override or easy way to achieve something without voice
